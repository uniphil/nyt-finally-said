  "Freedom is not a given -- and it's certainly not given by anything  'natural'",
  "Far too long have we succumb to bitter edge of the idea that power is lost in the sweet and tender.",
  "But most dangerous of all is the third horde: Us.",
  "We understand that these conversations are incredibly valuable to you. Too bad. They’re ours.",
  "That’s why the Almighty hath given us asses: that we might get off of them."
